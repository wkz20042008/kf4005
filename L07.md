## Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to help you to improve your understanding of POSIX
threads and to become familiar with some basic shell commands for 
monitoring the use of memory in a Linux system.

## Threads

1. Create a C program called `forkexample1.c` from the following code

     ```c
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <sys/wait.h>

     int globvar = 6;

     int main(void) {
     int var = 88;
     pid_t pid;

     printf("before fork\n");
     if ((pid = fork()) < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(-1);
     } else if (pid == 0) {
        globvar++; //child
        var++;
        printf("Child : pid = %d, globvar = %d, var = %d\n",
                 getpid(), globvar, var);
     } else {
        waitpid(pid, NULL, 0); // parent
        printf("Parent: pid = %d, globvar = %d, var = %d\n",
                 getpid(), globvar, var);
     }
     exit(0);
     }
     ```
     {: .code}
Compile and run the program. Observe the results carefully.

1. Now create a C program called `threadexample1.c` from the following code

     ```c
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <pthread.h>

     int globvar = 6;

     void *threadController(void *arg) {
         globvar++; 
         // var++; Notice this variable is not accessible
         printf("New thread : pid = %d, tid = 0x%lx, globvar = %d, "
                 "var = %s\n", getpid(), (unsigned long)pthread_self(),
                 globvar, "Not accessible");
         pthread_exit((void *)0);
     }

     int main(void) {
     int var = 88;
     pthread_t thread;

     printf("before thread create\n");
     if (pthread_create(&thread, NULL, threadController, NULL) != 0) {
         fprintf(stderr, "thread create failed\n");
         exit(-1);
     } else {
         pthread_join(thread, NULL); // main thread
         printf("Main thread: pid = %d, tid = 0x%lx, globvar = %d, " 
                "var = %d\n", getpid(), (unsigned long)pthread_self(),
                 globvar, var);
     }
     exit(0);
     }
     ```
     {: .code}
Compile and run the program. Observe the results carefully.

1. Answer the following questions

    1. Why is the process identifier (`pid`) *different* in the parent and child processes in `forkexample1.c`?
    1. Why is the process identifier (`pid`) *the same* in the main and new threads in `threadexample1.c`?
    1. Why is the value of `globvar` *different* in the parent and child processes in `forkexample1.c`?
    1. Why is the value of `globvar` *the same* in the main thread and new threads in `threadexample1.c`?

1. Consider the following program

     ```c
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <pthread.h>
     #include <assert.h>

     #define N_THREADS 5

     void *printMessage(void *arg) {
     int i;

     for (i = 0; i < 100; i += 1) {
       printf("This is a message from thread %ld\n", (long)arg);
     }
     printf("Thread %ld finished\n", (long)arg);
     pthread_exit((void *)0);
     }

     int main(void) {
     pthread_t thread[N_THREADS];
     int rc;
     long i;

     for (i = 0; i < N_THREADS; i += 1) {
       rc = pthread_create(&thread[i], NULL, printMessage, (void *)i);
       assert(rc == 0);
     }

     for (i = 0; i < N_THREADS; i += 1) {
       rc = pthread_join(thread[i], NULL);
       assert(rc == 0);
     }
     printf("Finished\n");
     exit(0);
     }
     ```
     {: .code}
Answer the following questions.

    1. How many threads will be created?
    1. Will each thread print the same message? If not, how will the messages differ?
    1. What do you expect the output of the program to be? 
    1. Create a program file, compile and build the program. Run it. Does the output match what you expected? Why (not)?
    1. Run the program several times. Is the output always the same? Why (not)?

<!--
1. Modify the previous program so that each thread prints a completely different message from the others.
   HINT: Create an array of messages of the same size as the number of threads. Initialise each element in
   the array of messages to a different string. Use the thread argument as an index into the array of messages.
-->

## Memory management

Use the following commands in a terminal window. Use the `man` command with
each of them to find out what each is doing.

1. `free`
2. `cat /proc/meminfo | less`
3. `vmstat -s`
4. `top`
5. `sudo dmidecode -t 17`
