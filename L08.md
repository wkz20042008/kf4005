# Introduction

This lab is intended to give you practice with using the `fdisk`, `mount` and `find` commands.

## The `fdisk` command

1. Execute the command

     ```sh
     $ ls -l /dev/sd*
     ```
     {: .code}
which device has multiple partitions associated with it?

1. Use `fdisk` to examine the partition table.

     ```sh
     $ sudo fdisk /dev/sda

     Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.27.1).
     Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
     Be careful before using the write command.


     Command (m for help): p
     ```
     {: .code}
Answer the following questions:
    * What is the total size of the drive in GiB?
    * What is the size of a sector in bytes?
    * How many sectors are there?
    * Calculate the total size of the drive in bytes, based on the number of sectors and the number of bytes per sector. Convert your answer to GiB. Does this answer match your answer above for the total size of the drive?
    * Which partitions are Windows partitions?
    * Which partitions are Linux partitions?
    * Which is the Linux swap partition?

1. Notice that you can use `fdisk` with the `-l` option if all you want to
do is list the partition information, e.g.

     ```sh
     student@C17775462-lnx:~$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda
     Disk /dev/sda: 477 GiB, 512110190592 bytes, 1000215216 sectors
     Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
     Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
     I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes
     Disklabel type: dos
     Disk identifier: 0x6fce0ecf

     Device     Boot     Start        End   Sectors   Size Id Type
     /dev/sda1  *         2048    1023999   1021952   499M  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT
     /dev/sda2         1024000  601147391 600123392 286.2G  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT
     /dev/sda3       601149438 1000214527 399065090 190.3G  5 Extended
     /dev/sda5       601149440  933351423 332201984 158.4G 83 Linux
     /dev/sda6       933353472 1000214527  66861056  31.9G 82 Linux swap / Solaris

     Partition 3 does not start on physical sector boundary.
     ```
     {: .code}
This is the output from a machine in one of the network labs. You will may see 
something different when you do this on a machine in a different environment.

1. It is also possible to use `fdisk` with a disk image file, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ fdisk -l disk.img
     Disk disk.img: 2.5 GiB, 2684354560 bytes, 5242880 sectors
     Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
     Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
     I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
     Disklabel type: dos
     Disk identifier: 0x000e6d7d

     Device    Boot   Start     End Sectors  Size Id Type
     disk.img1 *       2048 3145727 3143680  1.5G 83 Linux
     disk.img2      3147774 5240831 2093058 1022M  5 Extended
     disk.img5      3147776 5240831 2093056 1022M 82 Linux swap / Solaris
     ```
     {: .code}
To try this out for yourself you'll need to obtain a disk image file. The 
most efficient way to do this is to copy the file from a remotely mounted drive.
How you proceed depends on whether you are working in PAN S3/S4 or PAN F2/F3.

    **PAN S3/S4**
    1. The first time you do this, you may need to install `cifs-utils` on
your machine.

       ```sh
       $ sudo apt-get install cifs-utils
       ```
    1. Right-click on the link for the shell script [mount_nas](mount_nas) and 
choose `Save link as...` This will download the script to mount the NAS drive.
Make sure it is executable. Run the script and check that the drive has been mounted.  

       ```sh
       $ chmod a+x mount_nas
       $ ./mount_nas
       $ ls /mnt
       ```
    {: .note}

    **PAN F2/F3**
    1. The first time you do this, you may need to install `nfs-common` on
your machine.

       ```sh
       $ sudo apt-get install nfs-common
       ```
    1. Right-click on the link for the shell script [mount_nfs](mount_nfs) and 
choose `Save link as...` This will download the script to mount the NFS drive.
Make sure it is executable. Run the script and check that the drive has been mounted.  

       ```sh
       $ chmod a+x mount_nfs
       $ ./mount_nfs
       $ ls /mnt
       ```
    {: .note}

1. Now copy the disk image file and try the `fdisk` exercise above.

   ```sh
   $ cp /mnt/KF4005/disk.img .
   $ fdisk -l disk.img
   ```
   {: .code}

## The `mount` and `umount` commands

1. Create a directory to act as a mount point, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ mkdir mnt
     ```
     {: .code}
1. Enter a command to mount the larger of the Windows partitions shown in the `fdisk` output above. Use your new mount point `mnt`. Remember that
the `mount` command is used like this: `sudo mount <partition name> <mount point>`

1. Enter a command to find out how many log files (files with the extension `.log`) there are in the `Windows` directory of the newly mounted partition.

1. What happens if you try to mount the same partition again?

1. A file system can be "unmounted" using the command `umount`. The `umount` command is used with the name of the directory where the file system is
mounted, e.g. `sudo umount mnt`. Use this command to unmount the Windows partition that you mounted earlier.

1. Use `fdisk` to examine the partition table of the raw disk image file that you downloaded earlier. Answer the following questions.
    * What is the total size of the drive in GiB?
    * What is the size of a sector in bytes?
    * How many sectors are there?
    * Calculate the total size of the drive in bytes, based on the number of sectors and the number of bytes per sector. Convert your answer to GiB. Does this answer match your answer above for the total size of the drive?
    * Which partitions are Linux partitions?
    * Which is the Linux swap partition?

1. Enter a command to mount the first Linux partition in the raw disk image to your mount point. Remember that you need to use the `loop` option so that
`mount` sees the raw disk image file as a block device. You also need to specify the offset of the partion in bytes, using the `offset` option. Refer to
the [lecture slides]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/B08.pdf) if you need a reminder about how to do this.

1. How many `.txt` files are there in the `/usr/share/doc/git` directory of the file system that you have just mounted?

1. Mounting LVM volumes from a disk image is trickier and outside the scope of this module. However, if you're interested, there's a 
[brief tutorial here](LVM.html).

## The `find` command

`find` is a very powerful command that can be used to explore a file system. You call it by specifying the directory from which you want the exploration to begin.
For example, `find /` will just list all the files in the file system (you may need to use `sudo` to avoid `permission denied` errors for those directories that
you do not have permission to read). If you just want to list the files starting at the `/bin` directory, use `find /bin`. Some very useful options with
`find` are

* `-name` : restrict your search to files whose names match a pattern, e.g.

```sh
$ find /usr/share -name "*.txt"
```
{: .code}
finds all `.txt` files, starting at the `/usr/share` directory.

* `-exec` : execute a command on each file that matches the search, e.g.

```sh
$ find /usr/share -name "*.txt" -exec grep Linux {} \;
```
{: .code}
finds all `.txt` files, starting at the `/usr/share` directory, which contain the string `Linux`. You can print out the name of each matching file by adding the
`-print` option, e.g.

```sh
$ find /usr/share -name "*.txt" -exec grep Linux {} \; -print
```
{: .code}
* `-printf` : print file metadata, e.g.

```sh
$ find /bin -printf "%Ax;%p"
```
{: .code}
prints the last access data and the file names of all of the files in the `/bin` directory. Use `man find` and look at the `-printf` option for all the metadata
and formatting possibilities.

Develop your own ideas about useful data and how to display it. Experiment
using the command line.

## The `tar` command

The `tar` command stores and extracts files from a tape or disk archive.
`tar` is a flexible command and has numerous options. As always, you
can use `man` to find out about the full set of options. For now you
should just practice the most frequent use cases.

1. Write a complete directory (and all sub-directories to an archive), e.g.

     ```sh
     $ tar cf fred.tar fred
     ```
     {: .code}
copies the entire contents of the `fred` directory to a file called `fred.tar`.
Notice that `c` is the option to `tar` that causes an archive to be
created. The `f` option allows you to specify the name of the file to hold
the archive. By convention this file name should have the  file extension
`.tar`. The final word on the command line specifies the name of the directory
that should be archived.

1. You can cause the archive to be save in compressed form by adding an 
additional option to the `tar` command, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ tar zcf fred.tgz fred
     ```
     {: .code}
Here the addition of the `z` option causes the archive to be compressed
using `gzip`. The convention here is to give the file name the extension
`.tgz` to indicate that it is a gzipped, tar file.

1. You can examine the contents of a tar file using the `t` option, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ tar tf fred.tar
     ```
     {: .code}
will list the contents of `fred.tar`, and

     ```sh
     $ tar ztf fred.tgz
     ```
     {: .code}
will list the contents of the gzipped, tar file, `fred.tgz`.

1. You can extract and verify the contents using the `x` option to
extract and the `v` option to verify, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ tar xvf fred.tar
     ```
     {: .code}
will extract the contents of `fred.tar`, and

     ```sh
     $ tar zxvf fred.tgz
     ```
     {: .code}
will extract the contents of `fred.tgz`.

Try the following exercise...

1. Change the current working directory to `/usr/share`
1. Use `ls` to explore the `gtk-doc` directory that you'll
find there.
1. Create a gzipped, tape archive of the `gtk-doc` directory. 
Call the archive `gtk-doc.tgz` and make sure that it is
saved in your home directory.
1. Change your current working directory to your home directory.
1. List the contents of `gtk-doc.tgz` to check it contains what you'd
expect.
1. Extract the contents of `gtk-doc.tgz`.
1. Use `ls` to explore the contents of the directory that you've
just extracted. Check that it contains the same files as in the
original directory.
1. Delete `gtk-doc` and `gtk-doc.tgz` from your home directory.
