# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to give you practice with the use of regular expressions and text processing tools in a UNIX environment.

## Preliminaries

Make sure that you have worked through chapters 19 and 20 of the [SHO16](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/assets/ra/TLCL.pdf).

## Regular Expressions 

1. What texts do each of these *extended regular expressions* match? Try them using `egrep` or `grep -E`. You need to make a file of text to be searched for matches, and you should enclose the regex to be matched in single quotation marks '...'.
  * `(un)?do`
  * `2[0-9]*000`
  * `(ab)+(c-e)+`
  * `itemi(z|s)(es?|ation)`
  * `[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{2,4}`

2. Devise an extended regular expression which will match
  *  a (UK) mobile phone number;
  *  the majority of UK post-codes: two upper-case letters followed by 1-2 digits, a space, 1-2 digits, and two more upper-case letters;
  *  an integer between 1 and 999999, optionally prefixed by a minus sign;
  *  a Northumbria University CIS module code;
  *  an IP address in the usual format;
  *  a MAC address in the usual format;
  *  a password of between 12 and 20 characters which are numerals, upper-case letters or lower-case letters.

3. The `less` program includes a search facility that allows the use of regular expressions, e.g.

    ``` sh
    $ less /etc/init/udev.conf
    /.*".*".*
    ```
will identify all the lines in the `udev.conf` file that contains a string (a sequence of characters inside double-quotes) and it
will highlight the strings so that you can identify them easily. (Note: there's only one such string in this file)
  * Use the less command to find all lines in `/etc/init/mountall.conf` that contain an option, i.e. a sequence of characters that
  starts with a `-` (hyphen) symbol. 

## Text processing utilities

1. Download the file [mcalendarLstg.txt]({{site.url}}/mcalendarLstg.txt). This is a listing of a program source file. Each line starts with a line number, then there is a TAB, 
   then the rest of the line.
    * Devise commands using `head` or `tail` to display the first 20 lines, the last 20 lines, and *all but* the last 20 lines.
    * Using `cut`, obtain a file called `calendar.c` consisting of the listing file *minus* the line numbers.
    * In which lines of `mcalendarLstg.txt` does the word `void` occur? No, don't look in the file, use `grep -E`.
    * Using `grep -E`, determine which lines of `mcalendarLstg.txt` contain strings -- zero or more characters between a pair of double quote-marks.

2. `cd` to a directory with a few files in it and run

    ``` sh
    $ ls -l | cut -d " " -f 5- 
    ```
    * Compare with the output of `ls -l` and explain exactly what `cut` is doing here.
    * What information is being output?
    * What happens if instead you do `ls -l | cut -d " " -f 5-8`? Why is this not producing fields 5 - 8 of the `ls -l` display?

3.  Now try the commands
    * `ls -l | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 5-` and
    * `ls -l | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 5-8` 
and explain the effect the `tr -s " "` command is having. Try the same commands on the `/bin` directory. What is going wrong here? Can you add
a command to the pipeline to fix it?

4. 
    * Devise a command to output just the sizes and names of the files in the working directory and nothing else.
    * Upgrade this command so that the sizes and names are separated by a TAB (hint: use a second `tr` command). 
    * Make this command into a script which will take a directory path as a run-time argument and output this information for the specified directory.

5. Write a script that takes as parameters a (path to a) file and a string of characters and deletes all occurrences of characters in the string from the file. Leave the original file intact but send the output to another file. Use the `tr` command.

6. Download file [scorebd.txt]({{site.url}}/scorebd.txt)
    * Use the `tr` command to make another file in which the commas are replaced by TABs.
    * Use the `sort` command to make another file in which the lines are in alphabetical order.
    * Use the `sort` command to make another file in which the lines are in numerical order, according to the numbers in the second field.

7. By piping the output of a `ls -l` command to a `sort` command, obtain a file listing in order of file size, from *largest* to *smallest*.
