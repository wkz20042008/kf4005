## Introduction

This lab is intended to give you an opportunity to practice the 
`bash` exercises that will be required in your practical assessment.

You are required to demonstrate an ability to apply methods and tools that
would aid you in analysing a raw disk image such as might be obtained from a
computer that you suspect may have been compromised. You should have with you
the `disk_analysis` shell script that you have prepared to help you with
this analysis. You will need to run this script at the appropriate point to
generate a useful report. 

Work through the instructions below. You should enter the required shell 
commands using a command terminal. The commands that you enter will be saved 
automatically in the file `/home/student/.bash_history`. You should redirect
the output from all commands to a file called `bashoutput.txt`. Ensure
that you start with an empty file and that you always *append* output
to the file rather than overwriting it. At the end 
of the session you should copy your `.bash_history` file to a file
called `bashinput.txt`. Use your regular text editor, e.g., nano, to edit both
`bashinput.txt` and `bashoutput.txt`. Your `bashinput.txt` should contain
just the commands required to satisfy the requirements below. Add
comments to the file so that it is clear which command has been
used to solve which problem. Add the problem number to the comment
associated with the corresponding command. Your `bashoutput.txt` file
should contain just the output produced by the commands in your
edited `bashinput.txt` file. Again, you should add numbered comments
to the output to make it clear which output goes with which 
problem.



## Practice (50%)

### Create directories for the lab session (2 marks)

Enter a command in your terminal window to create directories for this assessed
lab. The directories should be created in `/home/student` and should be called
`/home/student/<your_user_id>/kf4005/bin` where you should replace
`<your_user_id>` with your actual user id, e.g. `w12345678`. Create all
directories using a single command.

### Copy the script, make it executable and add your bin directory to your PATH (2 marks)

Enter commands to copy your `disk_analysis` script
into the `bin` directory that you've just created, make the script executable
and add the `bin` directory to your `PATH`. The `PATH` modification should
be temporary, using a simple shell command, rather than by editing `.bashrc`.

### Obtain the raw disk image  (2 marks)

Direct your browser to `http://nas3.offcampusnetwork.co.uk` and login
   using the username `student` and the usual password. Use the file app on the
   home page to browse to `modules -> KF4005` and then download the file
   `KF4005.img` (right-click on the file name and select `Download`). Note this file is about 3GB and the
download may take a few minutes to complete. 

Enter a command to copy the raw disk image from `KF4005.img` into
`/home/student/<your_user_id>/kf4005`. 


### Examine the partition table (2 marks)

Enter commands to show the partition table of the raw
disk image. Ensure that the output is sent to `bashoutput.txt`.

### Partition table questions (4 marks)

Briefly answer the following questions about the partition table. Enter
commands to append your answers to your output file (`bashoutput.txt`).

1. What is the total size of the raw disk image in bytes?
2. What is the name of the bootable partition?
3. What is the offset in bytes of the start of the first partition? (show your
   working)


### Mount the raw disk image (6 marks)

Enter commands to
1. Create a mount point for the raw disk image.
    * Call the mount point `/home/student/<your_user_id>/kf4005/image`
2. Mount the raw disk image to the mount point
    * the image must be mounted read-only
    * the image must be mounted so that access times will not be changed when the image is accessed
  
### Show the mount table (2 marks)

Enter a command to show the mount table. Ensure that the output is sent
to `bashoutput.txt`.

### Results from the disk_image_analysis (15 marks) 

Enter commands to run your `disk_image_analysis` script on the disk image
file that you have already mounted at
`/home/student/<your_user_id>/kf4005/image`. The extracted file
metadata should be sent to a file called `filedata.txt` and the
output from the SQL query should be sent to a file called `sqlout.txt`.
You will be assessed on how well the output satisfies the requirements for the
script in the assignment specification.

Some points to consider:

1. You may need to run your script as `sudo`, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ sudo disk_image_analysis ...
     ```
     {: .code}

1. You have already mounted the disk image, so you should use the option to bypass mounting the image again, e.g.

    ```sh
    $ sudo disk_image_analysis -n ...
    ```
    {: .code}
1. If your script does not have an option to bypasss mounting, you should unmount the disk image before running your script, e.g.

    ```
    $ sudo umount ...
    $ sudo disk_image_analysis ...
    ```
    {: .code}

### Quality of the disk_image_analysis script (15 marks)

Your `disk_image_analysis` script will be assessed using the 
following criteria:

    1. Use of functions - functional decomposition
    2. Use of meaningful variable and function names
    3. Use of layout that aids the understanding of the reader
etc.
    4. Use of bash shell script idioms: parameter expansion, command
substitution etc.     
    5. Use of SQL.

## Finishing up and submitting your work

1. Exit from your current session to ensure that the commands from your
session are save into your `.bash_history` file, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ exit
     ```
     {:.code}     
1. Open a new terminal window and set the current working directory to
`/home/student/<your_user_id>/kf4005`.
1. Copy the `/home/student/.bash_history` file to `bashinput.txt`. Edit
this file so that it contains just the commands needed to satisfy the
requirements of the assessed lab. Add comments to the file to make
it clear which command was used to solve each problem.
1. Edit the file `bashoutput.txt` so that it is clear which output
is the solution to each problem.
1. Create a new directory called `deliverables`.
1. Copy the following files into the deliverables directory:
    * `bashinput.txt`
    * `bashoutput.txt`
    * `disk_image_anaysis.sh`
    * `filedata.txt`
    * `sqlout.txt`
1. Create a gzipped, tar file of the `deliverables` directory and
check that it contains the required files:

     ```sh
     $ tar zcf deliverables.tgz deliverables
     $ tar ztf deliverables.tgz
     deliverables/
     deliverables/bashinput.txt
     deliverables/bashoutput.txt
     deliverables/sqlout.txt
     deliverables/filedata.txt
     deliverables/disk_image_analysis.sh     
     ```
     {: .code}
1. Upload `deliverables.tgz` to Blackboard (eLP) using the link
`Assessment->Practice Lab`. Check your submission. Failure to submit
correctly may result in the award of a mark of zero for this part of the
assignment.
1. Clean up after yourself:
    * Delete `deliverables.tgz`
    * Delete the `deliverables` directory
    * Delete your working directory, `/home/student/<your-user-id>`
1. You're done! You may leave the lab.
