## Introduction


<p class="lead">
An operating system is the software that allows your applications to make use of
the hardware resources of your computing devices. Whether itâ€™s a video streaming
application on your laptop, a messaging app on your smartphone or a web server
in a huge data centre, they all rely on the services of an operating system to
work. This module will help you to understand what an operating system is, how
it works and how to manage it.

You will be taught in well-equipped computing
laboratories with modern operating systems that you can investigate and
experiment with. Your understanding of operating systems concepts and your
practical skills in working with operating systems will be assessed in lab-based
coursework exercises. This module will help you to develop a sound understanding
of a key component in any computing system and will inform your thinking at
every stage of your computing career.

Lectures are the main vehicle for introducing fundamental concepts and
principles and for providing context and motivation. You will be
expected to prepare for lecture topics and deepen your understanding
of course material by studying course texts and technical
literature. Seminars and laboratory sessions support the lecture
programme by providing you with opportunities to identify and
apply appropriate techniques for the application and implementation of
a variety of OS services.

## Synopsis

This module introduces you to the fundamentals of operating systems:
processes/threads, communication, memory management, file systems, I/O,
security, scripting languages and tools. You will study:

1. processes and threads: concepts, use and implementation, creation and
destruction, context switching, scheduling;

2. communication (IPC): shared memory, message passing, pipes;

3. memory management: memory allocation schemes, paging, virtual memory;

4. persistent storage and file systems: file concept, file system structure and
implementation, directories, free space allocation;

5. I/O: input and output devices, device handlers, the I/O API;

6. security:  access control, user authentication;

7. scripting languages and tools: use of languages and tools (e.g. the command
shell, Python) for monitoring, investigating and administering an operating
system and its resources.

## Teaching Plan / Learning Materials

The following is a *provisional* guide to the organisation of
this part of the module for this year. These arrangements are subject to

<br/>

<p class="text-info">
In addition to the taught sessions, you are expected to undertake
independent and directed learning. This is a 20-credit module, for
which the expected student workload is 200 hours. You should be spending about 13 hours per week on
this module.
</p>

## Assessment

Formative assessment comprises a variety of theoretical and practical exercises,
with opportunities for discussion with tutors and colleagues.
Feedback on formative assessment will be given during the workshop sessions.

Summative assessment comprises a single coursework assignment. You will be
required to undertake a number of theoretical and practical, lab-based
exercises, leading to the completion of a set of questions about the work that
you have done. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are familiar
with the assessment regulations and that you comply with them in providing your 
summative assessment.

[**Assessment regulations and guidance**](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/university-services/academic-registry/quality-and-teaching-excellence/assessment/guidance-for-students/)

Formal written feedback will be provided on summative assessment. The assignment
will assess all of the MLOs.

## Reading List

There is no essential textbook for this module. [SGG14] is an excellent
introduction to operating systems in general and can be used to supplement the
slides for the Lecture A stream of the module. [A-D15] also covers much of this
material and has the advantage of being available *free online*. The other
recommended books and papers give useful information on parts of the syllabus
only.
