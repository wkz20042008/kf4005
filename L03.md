## Introduction

This lab is based on the material in
[The Linux Command Line]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/TLCL.pdf) chapters
24 to 35.

> You can use **vi/vim** or other editors, such as **nano**, which some people may find more friendly to new users.

<!-- 
> It is worth going over the [Gentle Introduction to vi
> chapter]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/TLCL.pdf)
> as a passing familiarity with `vi` is always useful
-->

Scripts are very powerful tools in the hands of a Unix programmer.
Of the 4643 commands available through the PATH variable on my machine,
601 are shell scripts (about 12%).  This data itself was collected with a shell script
shown below (don't worry if you don't understand it yet!).

```sh
#/bin/bash
declare -A counts
for d in ${PATH//:/ }
do
        for f in $d/*
        do
                type=$(file -Lb $f|cut -d, -f1)
                counts["$type"]=$((${counts["$type"]}+1))
        done
done

declare -i total
for key in "${!counts[@]}"
do
        total+=${counts[$key]}
        echo -e ${counts[$key]} "\t" $key
done
echo -e $total "\t" total
```

## Exercises

Remember that the text in the blue boxes goes _into_ a file, that file has the
execute bit set and then the file is executed at the command prompt.

```sh
unix$ vi hello
unix$ chmod u+x hello
unix$ ./hello
Hello everyone!
unix$ ./hello
Hello everyone!
unix$ 
```
{: .question }

--------------

1. Try the hello world script from chapter 24.
	```sh
	#!/bin/bash
	echo "hello world"
	```
	{: .code}
2. We want to produce some reports with a header, modify the _here document_
   example from page 371
	```sh
	#!/bin/bash
	cat<<eof
	| title: A Report Generator for $HOST
    | author: A N Other ($LOGNAME)
	| date: $
	eof
	```
	{: .code}
3. You may want to make use of a variable to store the real name of the
   author.  The header becomes.
	```sh
	#!/bin/bash
	NAME="Your name (you will need the quotes)"
	cat<<eof
	| title: A Report Generator for $HOST
    | author: $NAME   ($LOGNAME)
	| date: $
	eof
	```
	{: .code}
4. You may want to add the time and date to the header (see Shotts page 370)     

## Getting some data.
Positional parameters contain the parameters from the command line.

1. Recreate the `tidy` script from the lecture slides.
    ```sh
    #!/bin/sh
    cd $1
    mkdir src
    cp *.c src
    mkdir obj
    cp *.o obj
    ```
    {: .code}
 
    If you need some `.c` and `.o` files with which to work you can download
     and unzip some examples from
[examples.zip]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/examples.zip)
    {: .note}
2. Use the `if...fi` statement to check if the directories exist (`[ -d $1 ]`
   _etc_), if not create them.
3. Use a `for f in *.c` loop to test whether each file exists. If it does
   exist it can be moved.

## Command line Options
Shell scripts are _almost never_ interactive.  Control of the script's
behaviour is through command-line-options.  [Chapter 12 of the POSIX
standard](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html)
discusses the syntax and conventions used for options.

The shell provides a command `getops` that helps with the processing of shell
options.  (There is a [small
tutorial](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/howto/getopts_tutorial) online).
It has a small script illustrating the use of `getopt`.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
 
while getopts ":a:" opt; do
  case $opt in
    a)
      echo "-a was triggered, Parameter: $OPTARG" >&2
      ;;
    \?)
      echo "Invalid option: -$OPTARG" >&2
      exit 1
      ;;
    :)
      echo "Option -$OPTARG requires an argument." >&2
      exit 1
      ;;
  esac
done
```
{: .code}

1. Modify the `tidy` script to make use of command-line options, 
   a suggested set includes

   -d &lt;_dir_&gt;
   : A directory to tidy 

   -s &lt;_source_&gt;
   : a directory to copy the `.c` files into 

   -o &lt;_objects_&gt;
   : a directory ro copy the `.o` files into
