# Introduction

The objective of this lab is to help you to become familiar with some essential Linux commands.

# Linux tutorial

1. Work through the tutorial at [http://hesabu.net/unixtut](http://hesabu.net/unixtut).
2. Work through the sections of [Learning the Shell](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php) from 1. What is "The Shell"?
   through to 9. Permissions. Don't just read passively. Have a command line open and try everything. Experiment until you are
   comfortable with these ideas.
3. Develop your understanding further by reading Chapters 1-6 in [The Linux Command Line]({{site.raurl}}/TLCL.pdf). Have a command line open
and try out what you're reading about.
