## Introduction

This lab is concerned with several topics:
1. using functions in your shell scripts to make them easier to read, understand
and maintain;
1. using job control commands to monitor and control the processes running in
your system; and
1. understanding the main Unix system calls for managing processes.

## Shell functions

### Simple shell functions

Just as with any programming task, when writing a shell script it is often clearer to break your script
into a number of *functions* that are called from the main body of the script. This *modular decomposition*
makes your script easier to understand and maintain. It is also easier to *reuse* your code.

The syntax of a shell function looks like this

```sh
hello() {
  echo "Hello world"
}
```
It starts with the function name, `hello`, that you can choose yourself; then come the parentheses `()` and an
opening curly brace `{`; then you write the commands that you'd like the function to execute when it's called;
and finally there is a closing curly brace `}`.

Here's an example of how the function can be called from the main body of the script:

```sh
hello() {
  echo "Hello world"

}

echo "This is the hello script"
hello
```

Type the code above into an editor and save it in a file called `hellofunc`. Make the file executable,
`chmod +x hellofunc`, and run it, `./hellofunc`. You should see the following output:

```
This is the hello script
Hello world
```

You can pass arguments to a shell function, just like you can pass arguments to the main shell
script on the command line. And you can refer to the arguments that have been passed using the
same positional notation, `$1, $2, $3, ...` etc. For example,

```sh
hello() {
  echo "Hello world, $1"
  echo $2
}

echo "This is the hello script"
hello David "Have a nice day"
```
shows a function that expects two arguments, a name followed by a greeting. It will generate the
output:

```
This is the hello script
Hello world, David
Have a nice day
```

Functions can have local variables. They are preceded by the key word `local`. For example,

```sh
#! /bin/bash

myFunc() {
  local x=10

  echo "The value of x in myFunc is $x"
}

x=2
echo "The value of x in main is $x"
myFunc
echo "After myFunc the value of x in main is now $x"
```

Use an editor to create this script. Save it in a file called `funclocals`.
Make the script executable, `chmod +x funclocals`. Run the script, `./funclocals`.

1. What is the value of `x` before the execution of `myFunc()`?
2. What is the value of `x` inside `myFunc()`?
3. What is the value of `x` after the execution of `myFunc()`?
4. Now edit the script to remove the word `local` from `myFunc()`. Run the
   script again. Answer questions 1-3 again. What does this tell you
   about local variables?

### Debugging

Put `set -x` immediately after the shebang line in one of your scripts and run it again.
You'll see that the script now gives you information about the progress of its execution.
This can be very helpful when you are trying to work out why a script is not behaving as you
would like it to. Try the example below.

```sh
#! /bin/bash

set -x

hello() {
  echo "Hello world, $1"
  echo $2
}

echo "This is the hello script"
hello David "Have a nice day"
```

You should see the following output.

```
+ echo 'This is the hello script'
This is the hello script
+ hello David 'Have a nice day'
+ echo 'Hello world, David'
Hello world, David
+ echo Have a nice day
Have a nice day
```
Notice the lines that start with the `+` symbol. Those lines have been added by
the debugger. These lines allow you to see exactly what is being executed by
the shell. For example, you can see exactly how the `hello()` function has been
called and what values have been assigned to parameters `$1` and `$2`. This can
be very helpful. Use this technique when you have a script that is not behaving
as you want.

### Using shell functions in practice

The script below is taken from the [lecture in week 3](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/assets/ra/B03.pdf).
There are several opportunities to improve the script by making use of functions.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

if [ $# -ne 3 ]; then
  echo "Your command: $0 $*"
  echo "Usage: tidy4 <tidy dir> <src dir> <obj dir>"
  exit 1
else
  tidyDir="$1"
  srcDir="$2"
  objDir="$3"
fi

if [ -d "$tidyDir" ]; then
  echo "Tidying directory $tidyDir ..."
else
  echo "$tidyDir does not exist"
  exit 1
fi
if [ ! -d "$srcDir" ]; then
  if [ -f "$srcDir" ]; then
    echo "$srcDir exists and is not a directory"
    exit 1
  else
    mkdir "$srcDir"
  fi
fi
CFILES=$tidyDir/*.c*
if stat -t $CFILES >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  mv $CFILES $srcDir;
  echo "Moved C and C++ files to $srcDir"
fi
if [ ! -d "$objDir" ]; then
  if [ -f "$objDir" ]; then
    echo "$objDir exists and is not a directory"
    exit 1
  else
    mkdir "$objDir"
  fi
fi
OBJFILES=$tidyDir/*.o
if stat -t $OBJFILES >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  mv $OBJFILES $objDir
  echo "Moved object files to $objDir"
fi
echo "... done"
```

Modify this script to use the following functions:

1. A `usage()` function that checks the number of command line arguments
   and prints a helpful message before exiting with an error code if the
   number is not what is expected. The actual and expected number of arguments
   should be parameters to the function.

2. A `dirExists()` function that checks if a name exists as a directory,
   and prints a helpful message before exiting with an error code, if not.
   The directory name should be a parameter of the function. You could pass
   an informative message as a second argument, if you wish.

3. An `ensureDir()` function that checks if a name exists
   as a directory and returns successfully if so. If the
   name does not exist as a directory, the function should create a directory
   with the given name, if possible, or exit with an error code if not.

4. A `moveFiles()` function that moves all the files with a given filename
   extension (e.g. `.c`) from one directory to another, if possible.  The
   function should do nothing if there are no files in the given directory with
   the given extension. The function should have the following parameters: the
   name of the directory containing the files; the filename extension; the name
   of the target directory;  and an informative message.

Rewrite the main body of the script to use these functions.

## Job control

These exercises demonstrate the basic properties on processes under
Unix like systems.  Through these you should gain an understanding
of what a process is, and the tools and techniques for managing
processes.

### The `ps` Command

1. Start a terminal window.

2. Type the command `ps` and note the processes it lists as
  running.

3. Create a few processes.  Do this by typing the command for the
process but put an ampersand `&` after it.

   ```sh
   xlogo &
   xedit &
   xeyes &
   gedit &
   vi &
   ```

4. You should now have a number of additional windows open.
Find the Terminal window you had opened.

5. Type the command `ps` again and note the changes to the
process list.
The results of the `ps` command show the list of processes running
under the terminal.
   * Why are no other process (such as the desktop) shown?
   * from the `man` pages can you tell what information is in
   the results.

6. Now start xterm from the prompt in the terminal window.

    ```sh
    xterm &
    ```
   * In the (new) xterm window start another few processes.
   *  Run `ps -f` in
      + the new xterm window
      +  the original terminal window
   *  What differences do you see?


### Stopping a Process
Again start a few processes in a terminal window as above.

1. run `ps` again.
2. note the process id number for one of the processes (xlogo)
3. type `kill -TERM <id>`.   What happened?
4. run `ps` again
5. now try `kill -KILL <id>` on another process.


### The `ps` Command - Options


1. run `ps -f` what additional information does this tell you?

2. run `ps -l` what additional information does this tell you?

3. In a terminal (from above) use

   ```sh
   ps --user your-id
   ```
or if you’re a little lazy (like me), `ps --user $(whoami)`

4. This shows all *your* processes. Could you see another user's processes?

5. Try the command `ps -e`, this should list all processes on the system.
You may need to scroll the list.


### Process Tree

1. In one of the windows you have open run

   ```sh
   ps --user $(whoami) --forest
   ```
Can you identify the ancestors of each process?

2. Now run

   ```sh
   pstree
   ```
Again, you may have to scroll back to see the whole list.

3. *Unix start up*: Look back through the full map of processes from pstree.
You should see a process called `init` (or `systemd`) at the root of the tree.


### The `top` command
Start another terminal and run `top`, this gives a realtime
  view of processes.  (You can end it when you are ready by pressing `q`)

1. start a couple of applications from the desktop menu
2. what changes do you see in the processes reported by `top`?


### Further work

Develop your understanding of Unix's process management commands by working
through [this tutorial](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0100.php).

## Unix system calls: fork(), exec(), wait(), exit()

This section is concerned with the main process management system calls provided
by the operating system. It uses the C API. The following program is the
example from the [lecture in week 4](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/assets/ra/B04.pdf).

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int globvar = 6;

int main(void) {
  int var = 88;
  pid_t pid;
  int status;

  printf("before fork\n");
  if ((pid = fork()) < 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
      exit(-1);
  } else if (pid == 0) { /* child */
      globvar++;
      var++;
      printf("pid = %d, globvar = %d, var = %d\n",
               getpid(), globvar, var);
      exit(0);
  } else { /* parent */
      waitpid(pid, &status, 0); // parent
      printf("pid = %d, globvar = %d, var = %d, child status = %d\n",
               getpid(), globvar, var, status);
  }
}
```
Use a text editor to create this program. Save it into a file
called `forkexample.c`. Compile the program: `gcc -o forkexample forkexample.c`,
and run it: `./forkexample`.

1. What is the process id of `forkexample`?
2. What is the process id of its child process?
3. What are the values of `globvar` and `var` in `forkexample` just before it
   terminates?
4. What are the values of `globvar` and `var` in the child process just
   before it terminates?
5. What do your answers to the previous questions tell you about the organisation
of a process's memory after `fork()`?

Here's a slightly different version of the `forkexample` program. It waits for the
user to press <ENTER> before terminating the parent and child processes. This
gives you a chance to use the `ps` command to see the processes being created and
destroyed.

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int globvar = 6;

int main(void) {
  int var = 88;
  pid_t pid;

  printf("before fork\n");
  if ((pid = fork()) < 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
      exit(-1);
  } else if (pid == 0) {
      globvar++; //child
      var++;
  } else {
      waitpid(pid, NULL, 0); // parent
  }
  printf("pid = %d, globvar = %d, var = %d\n",
           getpid(), globvar, var);
  if (pid == 0) {
      printf("Press <ENTER> to end the child ... ");
      while (getchar() != '\n') {};
  } else {
      printf("Press <ENTER> to end the parent ... ");
      while (getchar() != '\n') {};
  }
  exit(0);
}
```

1. Build this program.
2. Use the `ps` command to discover what terminal id has been given to your terminal. For example

   ```
   $ ps
   PID TTY          TIME CMD
   2637 pts/6    00:00:00 bash
   4086 pts/6    00:00:00 ps
   ```
shows that this terminal is associated with `pts/6`; the information is in the column headed
`TTY`.
3. Now run your new `forkexample` program and before you press enter to terminate anything,
   start up a new terminal and use the `ps` command to see what processes there are in the
   old terminal. For example

   ```
   $ ps -t pts/6
   ```
   Note: You'll need to use your own terminal id, not necessarily `pts/6`.
4. Press ENTER in the terminal where `forkexample` is running. Check the processes in the other terminal
   using `ps`. Do that again to terminate the parent process and use `ps` again to see what has happened.
5. Replace the line  `waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);` with `sleep(60);`. Build the program and then go back to 3.
   Do you observe any differences in the output of `ps`?
6. What does this tell you about process creation and destruction?

Here's a simple example of using `exec()`.

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main(void) {
  pid_t pid;
  char *args[] = {"ls", "-l", NULL};

  if ((pid = fork()) < 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
      exit(-1);
  } else if (pid == 0) { // child
      execl("/bin/ls", "ls" "-l", NULL);
  } else {               // parent
      waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
  }
  exit(0);
}
```

Replace the `execl()` line with a line that uses each of the following functions

1. `execlp()`,
2. `execv()`
3. `execvp()`

to give 3 more programs that have the same behaviour.
