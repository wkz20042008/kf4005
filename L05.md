## Introduction

This lab is concerned with processes:
1. using job control commands to monitor and control the processes running in
your system; and
1. understanding the main Unix system calls for managing processes.

## Job control

These exercises demonstrate the basic properties on processes under
Unix like systems.  Through these you should gain an understanding
of what a process is, and the tools and techniques for managing
processes.

### The `ps` Command

1. Start a terminal window.

2. Type the command `ps` and note the processes it lists as
  running.

3. Create a few processes.  Do this by typing the command for the
process but put an ampersand `&` after it.

     ```sh
     $ xlogo &
     $ xedit &
     $ xeyes &
     $ gedit &
     $ gvim &
     ```
     {: .code}

4. You should now have a number of additional windows open.
Find the Terminal window you had opened.

5. Type the command `ps` again and note the changes to the
process list.
The results of the `ps` command show the list of processes running
under the terminal.
   * Why are no other process (such as the desktop) shown?
   * from the `man` pages can you tell what information is in
   the results.

<!--
6. Now start xterm from the prompt in the terminal window.

     ```sh
     $ xterm &
     ```
     {: .code}
   * In the (new) xterm window start another few processes.
   *  Run `ps -f` in
      + the new xterm window
      +  the original terminal window
   *  What differences do you see?
-->

### Stopping a Process
Again start a few processes in a terminal window as above.

1. run `ps` again.
2. note the process id number for one of the processes (xlogo)
3. type `kill -TERM <id>`.   What happened?
4. run `ps` again

<!--
5. now try `kill -KILL <id>` on another process.
-->

### The `ps` Command - Options


1. run `ps -f` what additional information does this tell you?

<!--
2. run `ps -l` what additional information does this tell you?
-->
2. In a terminal (from above) use

     ```sh
     $ ps --user your-id
     ```
     {: .code}
or if youâ€™re a little lazy (like me), `ps --user $(whoami)`

3. This shows all *your* processes. Could you see another user's processes?

4. Try the command `ps -e`, this should list all processes on the system.
You may need to scroll the list.


### Process Tree

1. In one of the windows you have open run

     ```sh
     $ ps --user $(whoami) --forest
     ```
     {: .code}
Can you identify the ancestors of each process?

2. Now run

     ```sh
     $ pstree
     ```
     {: .code}
Again, you may have to scroll back to see the whole list.

3. *Unix start up*: Look back through the full map of processes from pstree.
You should see a process called `init` (or `systemd`) at the root of the tree.


### The `top` command
Start another terminal and run `top`, this gives a realtime
  view of processes.  (You can end it when you are ready by pressing `q`)

1. start a couple of applications from the desktop menu
2. what changes do you see in the processes reported by `top`?


### Further work

Develop your understanding of Unix's process management commands by working
through [this tutorial](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0100.php).

## Unix system calls: fork(), exec(), wait(), exit()

This section is concerned with the main process management system calls provided
by the operating system. It uses the C API. The following program is the
example from the [lecture in week 4](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/assets/ra/B04.pdf).

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int globvar = 6;

int main(void) {
  int var = 88;
  pid_t pid;
  int status;

  printf("before fork\n");
  if ((pid = fork()) < 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
      exit(-1);
  } else if (pid == 0) { /* child */
      globvar++;
      var++;
      printf("pid = %d, globvar = %d, var = %d\n",
               getpid(), globvar, var);
      exit(0);
  } else { /* parent */
      waitpid(pid, &status, 0); // parent
      printf("pid = %d, globvar = %d, var = %d, child status = %d\n",
               getpid(), globvar, var, status);
  }
}
```
{: .code}
Use a text editor to create this program. Save it into a file
called `forkexample.c`. Compile the program: `gcc -o forkexample forkexample.c`,
and run it: `./forkexample`.

1. What is the process id of `forkexample`?
2. What is the process id of its child process?
3. What are the values of `globvar` and `var` in `forkexample` just before it
   terminates?
4. What are the values of `globvar` and `var` in the child process just
   before it terminates?
5. What do your answers to the previous questions tell you about the organisation
of a process's memory after `fork()`?

Here's a slightly different version of the `forkexample` program. It waits for the
user to press <ENTER> before terminating the parent and child processes. This
gives you a chance to use the `ps` command to see the processes being created and
destroyed.

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int globvar = 6;

int main(void) {
  int var = 88;
  pid_t pid;

  printf("before fork\n");
  if ((pid = fork()) < 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
      exit(-1);
  } else if (pid == 0) {
      globvar++; //child
      var++;
  } else {
      waitpid(pid, NULL, 0); // parent
  }
  printf("pid = %d, globvar = %d, var = %d\n",
           getpid(), globvar, var);
  if (pid == 0) {
      printf("Press <ENTER> to end the child ... ");
      while (getchar() != '\n') {};
  } else {
      printf("Press <ENTER> to end the parent ... ");
      while (getchar() != '\n') {};
  }
  exit(0);
}
```
{: .code}
1. Build this program.
2. Use the `ps` command to discover what terminal id has been given to your terminal. For example

     ```sh
     $ ps
     PID TTY          TIME CMD
     2637 pts/6    00:00:00 bash
     4086 pts/6    00:00:00 ps
     ```
     {: .code}
shows that this terminal is associated with `pts/6`; the information is in the column headed
`TTY`.
3. Now run your new `forkexample` program and before you press enter to terminate anything,
   start up a new terminal and use the `ps` command to see what processes there are in the
   old terminal. For example

     ```sh
     $ ps -t pts/6
     ```
     {: .code}
   Note: You'll need to use your own terminal id, not necessarily `pts/6`.
4. Press ENTER in the terminal where `forkexample` is running. Check the processes in the other terminal
   using `ps`. Do that again to terminate the parent process and use `ps` again to see what has happened.
5. Replace the line  `waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);` with `sleep(60);`. Build the program and then go back to 3.
   Do you observe any differences in the output of `ps`?
6. What does this tell you about process creation and destruction?

Here's a simple example of using `exec()`.

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main(void) {
  pid_t pid;
  char *args[] = {"ls", "-l", NULL};

  if ((pid = fork()) < 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
      exit(-1);
  } else if (pid == 0) { // child
      execl("/bin/ls", "ls" "-l", NULL);
  } else {               // parent
      waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
  }
  exit(0);
}
```
{: .code}
Replace the `execl()` line with a line that uses each of the following functions

1. `execlp()`,
2. `execv()`
3. `execvp()`

to give 3 more programs that have the same behaviour.
