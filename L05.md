## Introduction

Your aim in this lab is to become familar with the management and use of simple
databases using SQL. You will use the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database
management system (DBMS) for the practical work. MySQL is the most widely used
open-source DBMS currently available. The lab assumes that you are working in a
Linux environment (Ubuntu 16.04) but most methods that you see here will work
in any environment (e.g. Mac OS/X, Windows, etc). You may find it helpful to
refer to the lecture slides of week 4 for more
information needed to complete some of the exercises.

At the end of this lab, you should know how to:

* install MySQL
* create a database
* add tables to a database
* insert data into tables
* use SELECT...FROM...WHERE to access data from a single table
* summarise data
* access data from multiple tables
* delete data
* create a new user of the MySQL server and grant permissions

## Installation of MySQL

1. Firstly, check to see if MySQL is already installed on your system:

     ```sh
     $ dpkg -l | grep mysql
     ```
     {: .code}
   If you see output similar to the following

     ```
     ii  mysql-client-5.7        5.7.21-0ubuntu0.16.04.1  amd64 MySQL database client binaries
     ii  mysql-client-core-5.7   5.7.21-0ubuntu0.16.04.1  amd64        MySQL database core client binaries
     ii  mysql-common            5.7.21-0ubuntu0.16.04.1  all          MySQL database common files, e.g. /etc/mysql/my.cnf
     ii  mysql-server            5.7.21-0ubuntu0.16.04.1  all          MySQL database server (metapackage depending on the latest version)
     ii  mysql-server-5.7        5.7.21-0ubuntu0.16.04.1  amd64        MySQL database server binaries and system database setup
     ii  mysql-server-core-5.7   5.7.21-0ubuntu0.16.04.1  amd64        MySQL database server binaries
     ```
     {: .code}
   then you already have the MySQL components installed and you can skip the next step.

1. If MySQL is not already installed, install it as follows:

     ```sh
     $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
     ```
     {: .code}
   During installation you will be prompted to enter a password for the root
   user. This is referring to the root user of the MySQL server, not the
   root user of your OS. Choose a password and make sure that you
   remember it. If you are working in a University lab, we suggest that you
   use the same password that you use to log in to your OS.

1. You can check that MySQL has been installed and the server has been started:

     ```sh
     $ systemctl status mysql.service
     ```
     {: .code}
   You should see some output like this:

     ```
     mysql.service - MySQL Community Server
       Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mysql.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
       Active: active (running) since Sat 2018-02-17 20:00:28 GMT; 14h ago
     Main PID: 31048 (mysqld)
        Tasks: 28
       Memory: 130.3M
          CPU: 24.616s
      CGroup: /system.slice/mysql.service
              └─31048 /usr/sbin/mysqld

     Feb 17 20:00:26 red systemd[1]: Starting MySQL Community Server...
     Feb 17 20:00:28 red systemd[1]: Started MySQL Community Server.
     ```
     {: .code}

1. You can stop, start, or restart the MySQL server:

     ```sh
     $ sudo systemctl stop mysql.service
     $ sudo systemctl start mysql.service
     $ sudo systemctl restart mysql.service
     ```
     {: .code}

## Connecting to and disconnecting from the server

1. You can connect to the server as the root user like this:

     ```sh
     $ mysql -u root -p
     Enter password: ***********
     ```
     {: .code}
   Use the root password at the `Enter password:` prompt.
   When you have connected, you should see some output like this:

     ```
     Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
     Your MySQL connection id is 4
     Server version: 5.7.21-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 (Ubuntu)

     Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

     mysql>
     ```
     {: .code}
   The prompt `mysql>` shows that your subsequent commands will be sent to 
   the MySQL server.

1. You can disconnect from the MySQL server:

     ```sql
     mysql> QUIT;
     Bye
     ```
     {: .code}
   There's more information about connecting to and disconnecting from a MySQL
   server in the [reference
   manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/connecting-disconnecting.html).
   We'll assume that you're connected to the MySQL server as the root user in
   the rest of these exercises. You would not normally work like this but it
   avoids the need to talk about users and permissions. We'll show you how to
   create other users and assign permissions to them at the end.

## Interacting with the DBMS

1. Try out some of the basic commands, e.g.

    1. `SHOW DATABASES;`
    1. `SHOW TABLES IN performance_schema;`
    1. `SHOW COLUMNS IN performance_schema.users;`
    1. `DESCRIBE performance_schema.users;`

1. Now create a database of your own and select it for use, e.g.

     ```sql
     mysql> CREATE DATABASE menagerie;
     mysql> USE menagerie;
     ```
     {: .code}

## Create a table and load data into it

1. Create a table to hold data about pets, e.g.

     ```sql
     mysql> CREATE TABLE pet (name VARCHAR(20), owner VARCHAR(20),
         -> species VARCHAR(20), sex CHAR(1), birth DATE, death DATE);
     ```
     {: .code}

1. An easy way to get data into your table is to load it from a simple
text file. Download the file [pet.txt]({{site.baseurl}}/pet.txt) to your
current working directory. This file contains one entry per line, where each
line is a tab-separated list of attribute values. You can load this
file into your table as follows:

     ```sql
     mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'pet.txt' INTO TABLE pet;
     ```
     {: .code}

## Simple SQL queries

1. Examine the contents of your table

     ```sql
     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet;
     ```
     {: .code}

1. Write queries for the following

    1. List the name, species and date of birth of all of Harold's pets
    1. List the name, species and date of birth of all the male pets
    1. List the name, owner and date of death of all pets who have died

## Modifying a table

1. Add a new row to your pet table to record the details of a pet with the
following details. Check your table after you have made the new entry.

     ```
     'Puffball', 'Diane', 'hamster', 'f', '1999-03-30', NULL
     ```
     {: .code}

1. Add a new column to the pet table to record the weight of each pet. Update
the table to contain weights as follows:

     ```
     name       weight

     Fluffy      2345
     Claws       4321
     Slim       10123
     Buffy       6543
     Puffball      45
     ```
     {: .code}

## Using aggregate queries

1. Write queries for the following

    1. List the owners and the weight of their heaviest pet
    1. List all species and the weight of the lightest member of each
species
    1. Rewrite the previous query to show the list in weight order from
heaviest to lightest


## Getting data from multiple tables

1. Download the file [event.txt](event.txt) and look at it 
using a text editor

1. Create a table, called `event`, to hold the data in `event.txt`

1. Load the data from `event.txt` into the `event` table

1. Observe the effect of the `JOIN` command by trying the following query

     ```sql
     mysql> SELECT *
         -> FROM pet JOIN event;
     ```
     {: .code}
Notice that it gives you the *CROSS PRODUCT* (*Cartesian PRODUCT*) of the
rows in the `pet` table with the rows in the `event` table.

   **Aside** The Cartesian product of two sets $$A$$ and $$B$$ is written as
   $$A \times B$$ (hence the name cross-product) and is formed by taking all
   the pairs that can be constructed by taking an element from $$A$$ and
   pairing it with an element from $$B$$, e.g. let
   \\[ A = \\{a, b, c\\} \\], and
   \\[ B = \\{1, 2\\} \\]
   then the Cartesian product, $$A \times B$$ is as follows
   \\[ A \times B = \\{(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 1), (a, 2), (b, 2), (c, 2)\\} \\]
   Notice that if there are $$n$$ elements in set $$A$$ and $$m$$ elements in
   $$B$$ then there are $$m \cdot n$$ elements in the Cartesian product
   $$A \times B$$, e.g. there are 3 elements in $$A$$ and 2 elements in $$B$$
   and a total of 6 elements in $$A \times B$$. Now notice that there are 5
   rows in the pet table, 6 rows in the event table, and a total of
   30 rows in the result of SELECT * FROM pet JOIN event;
   {: .note}

1. Now try

     ```sql
     mysql> SELECT * 
         -> FROM pet JOIN event
         -> ON (pet.name = event.name);
     ```
     {: .code}
Notice that the result of the JOIN has been filtered so that the
result contains only those rows that satisfy the constraint, 
`pet.name = event.name`.

1. Now write queries to solve the following

    1. List all those owners whose pets have had a litter
    1. List the name, birth date, weight, event type and event date of
all those pets who have had a litter, ordered by event date
    
<!--    
    1. List the name, birth date, event date, and age at the time of
delivery, of all those pets who have had a litter (*Hint*: Look at
the [MySQL tutorial on Date Calculations](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-calculations.html) to help with working out the age)
-->


## Deleting data

You can delete data from a table using the `DELETE` command, e.g.

   ```sql
   mysql> DELETE FROM pet WHERE name = 'Slim';
   ```
   {: .code}
Check that `Slim` has well and truly departed!

You can delete all of the data in a table, e.g.

   ```sql
   mysql> DELETE FROM pet;
   ```
   {: .code}
This removes all the records but leaves the table schema in place.

You can delete the table completely, records and table schema, using
the `DROP` command, e.g.

   ```sql
   mysql> DROP TABLE pet;
   ```
   {: .code}

## Creating a new user and granting permissions

1. Work through [Etel Sverdlov's
   tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-new-user-and-grant-permissions-in-mysql)
   on this topic.

1. As the root user, 
    * create a database called KF4005
    * create a MySQL user called `student` for the server on the `localhost`,
   with the same password for the `student` user as they would use to log in
   to the OS
    * ensure that the student user has all privileges in the KF4005 database but
   no privileges to do anything else

1. Create a couple of tables, insert and delete some data, perform some
queries. Check that you are not able to use any databases other than KF4005.
